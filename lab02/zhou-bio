        My name is Annie Zhou. I'm major in Applied Data Analytics, and I'm interested in data analyzing. I know how to use most of the microsoft things and have coding experience. I like to watch anime in my spare time. I always listen to music when I'm doing my work. I love cats but I do not have any. I always go to my friend's house and play with her cats.
